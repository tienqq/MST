This project implements Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms to finding a minimum spanning tree within a graph. This version of Prim's algorithm uses a priority queue. With implementing 2 algorithms, I had to differentiate between the parent vertex, hence one being a MSTVertex and the other a regular Vertex.
